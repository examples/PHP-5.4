PHP-5.4  - Built in webserver
=======

Take a look at PHP 5.4 Built in WebServer example.

to run this example, type: 
  
  php -S 0.0.0.0:444 -t /var/www/your_app_dir/ router.php

Take a look at router.php, it can define some ENV var... it have a "rewrite rule" too.

In this example, I'm using the [SlimPaces Framework](http://github.com/kinncj/Slim) to test the router.php
